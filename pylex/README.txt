1. Software dependecies
    - UnicodeData.txt : File contaning unicode data

2. We almost got all basic test cases working. It includes
    - Comments
    - New line
    - String literals
    - identifiers with their name having integers
    - Floating point numbers
    - Keywords
    - operators
    - Paranthesis
    - Indentation
    
    Few things that have to be implemented:
    - Reading input from file "test.py" instead of stdin
    - string literal does not work for some cases

3. Files turned in
    a) UnicodeData.txt	: File contaning unicode data
    b) makefile		: Make file to generate binary
    c) test.py		: Sample python code for testing
    d) README.txt	: README file
